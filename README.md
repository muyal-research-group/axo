<!-- #  MictlanX  -->
**ActiveX** is a prototype active object system for intensive application. For now the source code is kept private, and it is for the exclusive use of the *Muyal-ilal* research group.

## Prerequisites ðŸ§¾

- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Install Pip dependencies

  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Install Docker for your OS

## Getting started ðŸš€

Following the next steps to run the example a simple calculator.

```python
from axo import Axo,axo_method
from typing import List
from axo.contextmanager import ActiveXContextManager
from axo.endpoint.manager import DistributedEndpointManager

dem = DistributedEndpointManager()
dem.add_endpoint(
    endpoint_id="activex-endpoint-0",
    hostname="localhost",
    protocol="tcp",
    req_res_port=16667,
    pubsub_port=16666
)

acm = ActiveXContextManager.distributed(
    endpoint_manager=dem
)

class Calculator(Axo):
    def __init__(self):
      self.records:List[str] =[]

    @axo_method
    def add(self,x:int,y:int):
      res = x+y
      self.records.append("Add {} + {} = {}".format(x,y,res))
      return res

# It is very important to call the activex handler


calc = Calculator()
# Do some operations
res = calc.add(10,10) # -> 20
# Save the object
calc.persistify()
```


## Steps 
### Step 1. Deploy MictlanX
```
./run_mictlanx.sh
```
Once all services are up  and running execute the next bash script
```
./init_peers.sh && ./peers_status.sh
```

### Step 2. Init the virtualenviroment and install

```bash
poetry shell && poetry install
```
### Step 3. Run examples

Put a new object in MictlanX
```bash
python3 examples/01_put_calculator.py mycalculator01
```
Get a object from MictlanX and use it in ActiveX
```bash
python3 examples/02_get_calculator.py mycalculator01
```

## Examples
### 1. Heatmap producer

The implementation of the heatmap producer object is over ```examples/definitions/plot.py```. You can see that there are 2 annotated attributes. These attributes are of the GetKey and PutPath type:

- GetKey: It is a key and it should look for it in the storage service.
- PutPath: It is a path to a file to be placed in the storage service.

```python
class HeatmapProducer(ActiveX):
    input_data_key:Annotated[str, GetKey] = "heatmap01inputdata"
    heatmap_output_path:Annotated[str,PutPath] = "examples/data/sample01.csv"
```

In this example the attribute ```input_data_key``` is annoted as a ```GetKey``` so the system tries to get the data from a storage service.  The attribute ```heatmap_output_path``` is annotated as a ```PutPath``` which means that the file at that path is gonna be allocated in the storage service.


First you must run the following example: 

```bash
python3 examples/04_heatmap_put.py myheatmap01
```


Then you can get the object from the storage service:

```bash
python3 examples/05_heatmap_get.py myheatmap01
```
